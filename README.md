# Text-Display-Tool
This is a basic website created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that serves as a simple text display tool. Users can input text, and it is immediately displayed within a styled text box on the webpage. This project showcases fundamental web development techniques and can be used as a starting point for building more comprehensive web applications.
